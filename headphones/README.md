# Headphones Web Page

## Project Overview
This project implements a fully responsive web page for a headphones product, built from scratch using only HTML and CSS. The design is faithfully based on a detailed Figma project by a professional UI/UX designer, replicating all visuals, typography, layout, and interactions without any external libraries or frameworks.

## Design Source
The entire web page layout and style are derived from the (https://www.figma.com/design/xIZpKZtorBF5O6wJygQndz/Homepage--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=VAu8J0Ltfs28FxmX-0)(https://savanna.alxafrica.com/projects/101330). The Figma file includes all design assets, typography details, color palettes, and interaction states used for this project.

## Fonts
This project uses the following fonts to match the design accurately:
- **Source Sans Pro** (for body text and UI elements)
- **Spin Cycle OT** (used in headings and brand accents)

If these fonts are not installed on your computer, you can download them from the following links:
- [Source Sans Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro)  
- [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)

## Responsive Design
The web page automatically switches to a mobile-friendly layout when the screen width is 480px or less. The mobile version ensures usability and readability on small devices by adjusting typography, layout, and spacing accordingly.

## Interactions
- **Links:** on hover and active states, link colors change to `#FF6565`.
- **Buttons:** on hover and active states, buttons apply an opacity of `0.9` for visual feedback.

## Layout and Styling
- The content width is capped at a maximum of 1000px and centered horizontally on the page for optimal readability.
- Float values from the design have been rounded for consistency and simplicity.
- The code uses CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain consistency and ease future updates.

## Project Structure
- All code resides in the `headphones` directory of this repository.
- The HTML file contains the semantic structure of the page.
- The CSS file handles all visual styling, layout, responsiveness, and interaction states.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file located in the `headphones` directory in any modern web browser.
3. Ensure fonts are installed locally or linked appropriately in the HTML for accurate display.
